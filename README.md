🍽️ Restaurant Data Analytics Dashboard

Cognifyz Technologies Internship Project

This repository showcases my end-to-end Data Analytics Internship tasks with Cognifyz Technologies, focusing on analyzing restaurant data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Streamlit.

Each level represents progressive analytical and visualization capabilities — from basic insights to fully interactive dashboards.

🚀 Project Overview

This project explores restaurant datasets to uncover insights about:

Cuisines

Locations

Price ranges

Ratings

Restaurant chains

Interactive Streamlit dashboards are built to make the analysis more intuitive and engaging.

🧩 Project Structure
Level	Task	Description	Tools Used

Level 1 - Task 2	City Analysis	Determine the city with most restaurants and highest average rating	Pandas, Streamlit Charts
Level 1 - Task 3	Price Range Distribution	Visualize restaurant distribution by price range and compute percentages	Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
Level 2 - Task 1	Geographic restaurant mapping	Display restaurant locations on map using Folium	Folium, Streamlit-Folium, Pandas
Level 2 - Task 2	Identify restaurant chains	Analyze popularity of chains across cities	Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn
Level 2 - Task 3	Restaurant Location Map	Interactive Folium map with clustering and color-coded ratings	Folium, Streamlit-Folium, Pandas
Level 2 - Task 4	Restaurant Chains Analysis	Compare performance, ratings, and votes for chains across multiple cities	Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
